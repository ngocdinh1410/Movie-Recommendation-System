# Movie-Recommendation-System
I created two recommendation system: a popularity-based system and pyspark ALS recommendation system


I used AWS S3 storage to store the movielens' files. They consisted of user ratings for different movies and metadata on the movies.


The first recommendation system created was popularity-based. However, this popularity-based recommendation system is very simple and not personalized. Every user was given the same 10 movie which are most popular. 


The first recommendation system was generated by manipulating a pandas dataframe, sort by popularity of movies. Ratings, other metadata were not considered


The second recommendation system was created using pyspark. The recommendation system is collaborative filtering, user-based recommendation system.


Data was split into 80/20 for train/test. The model generated a low RMSE, which is a good sign.


The two recommendation systems were compared by calculating if the 10 recommendations overlap. Result is there isn't much overlap due to the impersonalization of the first system.
